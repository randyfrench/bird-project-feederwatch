This is a project from TheCornellLab Project FeederWatch that I will be working on birds spotted at feeders.
The data is raw, taken from the site: https://feederwatch.org/explore/raw-dataset-requests/
I am using the checklist data 2021. 
From FeederWatch website:
"Data validation
As with all large-scale citizen science programs, it is impossible to validate each of the millions of records submitted to FeederWatch. Although we attempt to minimize errors, a small percentage of FeederWatch reports are incorrect and analysts must be aware that misidentifications, data entry errors, and other sources of error can evade our data validation system.

All FeederWatch data are passed through a series of geographically and temporally specific filters that “flag” reports of species (or high counts) that are unexpected at a given location at a certain time of the year. The geographic resolution is relatively coarse (one filter per state/province), and the temporal resolution is monthly. Only reports that are flagged by the filters undergo a systematic manual review. A flag may be removed by the expert reviewer without a request for supporting information, or additional evidence may be requested. If additional information is requested but is insufficient to validate the report, that record remains in the database and is identified as an unconfirmed report. Flagged records are identified using a combination of the Valid field and the Reviewed field as defined here:

Valid = 1; Reviewed = 0
Interpretation: Report did not trigger the automatic flagging system and was accepted into the database without review

Valid = 1; Reviewed = 1
Interpretation: Report triggered the flagging system and was approved by an expert reviewer

Valid = 0; Reviewed = 1
Interpretation: Report triggered a flag by the automated system and was reviewed; insufficient evidence was provided to confirm the report

Valid = 0; Reviewed = 0
Interpretation: Report triggered a flag by the automated system and awaits the review process"
